# ATTPWN
Next gen voicemail cracker for ATT using imaplib in python

This project was inspired by https://github.com/martinvigo/voicemailautomator

Instead of actually using twilio or another voip service to dial into voicemail, I discovered a way to login to a server running the imap service on port 143 (as well as port 993). 

As for now, I have only found the imap login server for at&t. Feel free to post your own urls for other carriers that have a similiar service.
